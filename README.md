# 🧠 Python Data Types Practice

This repository is dedicated to practicing **Python data types** and their conversions.  
It includes  tasks that demonstrate how to work with strings, integers, floats, booleans, and type-checking methods.

Each task is designed to build clarity and confidence in handling data types—essential for writing clean, bug-free Python code.

## ✅ What I Practiced with Data Types

- Converting between `str`, `int`, `float`, and `bool`  
- Using built-in methods like `int()`, `float()`, `str()`, and `isdigit()`  
- Understanding how Python treats booleans as numeric values  
- Differentiating between string concatenation and numeric addition  
- Validating user input before performing operations  
- Printing values with their data types using `type()`
